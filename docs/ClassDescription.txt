Container based framework.

Basic concrete classes ( logic/UI ) up to date 18.01.2014.

1.MainApp - container class, extends JFrame, has window event listeners, focust listener and key press listeners - reads XML, config file, collects referencies to all QADList(s) and QQuestion(s). Holds indexes of all QADLists, and all QQUestions. The last QADList is always for exiting the program. The MainApp always is a top focus listener!
MainApp is not builder class. It calls init() which populates QADList array. MainApp has almost no user logic. 

2.QADList - container class. No GUI extension. Container with list of QQUestions, has complicated logics for updating to next, previous and some custom logics about visits, and button presses.
